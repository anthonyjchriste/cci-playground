# Clojure

Clojure is a lisp dialect that runs on the JVM and can be ran in the browser or locally by compiling to JavaScript.

A great resource for starting with Clojure is the free book [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/). 

## 1. Clojure installation

[Leiningen](https://leiningen.org) is a Clojure build tool and the easiest way of getting started with Clojure.
